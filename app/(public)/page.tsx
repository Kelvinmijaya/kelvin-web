            ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m a Senior Software Engineer who loves building cool stuff
            with React or Javascript. Over the years, I&apos;ve become the go-to
            person for crafting awesome web applications that not only look good
            but also come with good performance, scalability, resilience, and
            seamless functionality.

          <p>
            I&apos;ve been on this journey for 10 years, tackling diverse
            projects and challenges â€“ from people management to ensuring every
            button click is as smooth as butter, I&apos;ve got it covered. I
            believe that creative problem-solving and staying in the loop with
            the latest tech trends will make a better version of everything.
